# URP Basic Lens Flares
A simple lens flare effect for Unity's universal render pipeline. Created for Unity 2019.3, but it should continue to work in future versions.

This was made for [a short tutorial](https://samdriver.xyz/articles/brightSpots.htm) explaining how to use a compute shader and DrawProceduralIndirect in a CustomRendererFeature.

As usual with Unity projects you'll need to do a little ritual after downloading. When you first open the project it'll take a few minutes to build the local library. You'll then need to Open Scene to open the actual sample scene in the project (Unity silently generates a default start scene and shows you that instead.) To be safe you should then restart Unity as some assets don't seem to deserialize completely.
