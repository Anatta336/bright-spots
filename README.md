# URP Bright Spot Flares
A simple lens flare effect for Unity's universal render pipeline. Created for Unity 2019.3, but it should continue to work in future versions.

This was made for [a short tutorial](https://samdriver.xyz/articles/brightSpots.htm) explaining how to use a compute shader and DrawProceduralIndirect in a CustomRendererFeature.
